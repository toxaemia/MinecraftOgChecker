# MinecraftOgChecker
simple python script that generates semi / og's and checks the Minecraft API to see if the name is available or not. Each available username gets then saved inside a .txt
(also included my list of currently over 5k available og's and semi-og's)

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python main.py
